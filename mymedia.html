    <p>My favourite song is nattu nattu.
        “Naatu Naatu,” a song from the hit Telugu-language film “RRR".
        The fast-paced song, which became the first Indian song to win the category.

    <h2>Prabhu Kumar Athukuri</h2>
    <p>My favourite movie is RRR.
        RRR is an entirely fictitious story incorporating the lives of two real-life Indian revolutionaries, namely Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, who fought against the British Raj and the Nizam of Hyderabad respectively. Charan plays Rama Raju while Rama Rao plays Komaram Bheem. The plot explores their stay in Delhi of the 1920s before they begin the fight for their country. Rajamouli stated that there had been a coincidence between the two Telugu tribal leaders and the events surrounding over them.
